      "description": "The Ada 4x4 is based on the early Lada Niva 2121. It was the only 2-doors vehicle in the game until update 1.10 adding in the M3S Truck. To get into the back seats, players need to lower the front seats (at least one) to get in the back, making this vehicle difficult to flee with when you are being chased or shot at (if you seat in the back). This is also the only vehicle on PC to have a spare wheel attachment (compared to the PS4 version where the Olga 24 has a spare tyre slot in the trunk) which is under the hood. It comes in 3 colors : Dark Blue, Green and Light Grey. It is currently the second best vehicle off-road (M3S truck being the first one with it's low top-speed and high grip). It is also the only drivable vehicle in DayZ to have rust spots on the bodywork (pointing at the steel quality and poor care given by the owners).",

It has an approximate top speed of 140kph when red-lining, although it's possible to reach speeds of at least 156kph. With its planet-like turning radius and relatively long gearing, the Olga has trouble getting up to speed, as most cars currently in the game have 4 gears and the Olga's gears are fairly long its underpowered engine can cause it to be very sluggish.",

However, when driving gentle throttle, the max speed is about 17 kph. It is advised to start and drive the M3S in the fourth gear, as it will give the best acceleration and highest top speed.",
